i. Approach 1: In this approach we loop through every number in the list that is returned from the fucntion doubleL and print it seperated by ' : '. The function doubleL take an integer in this case 5 and appends the doubled amount corresponding to intergers starting from 0 to less than 5.

Approach 2: This approach loops through a temporary created list that again doubles every interger from 0 to less than 5 and prints each number sperateted by ' : '.

Approach 3: This approach is similar to 1 expect it does not return a list. Instead every time the function doubleG is called the for loop is iterated once and yields i * 2 integer and leaves the fucntion and prints the corresponding value right away in the outer loop. Then the outer loop calls the doubleG fucntion again and this process is repeated for until all the doubleG function iterates n times which in this case yields 5 numbers in total.

ii. doubleG is classified as a generator function beacuse it uses the keyword yield and only generates one value at a time when it is called. The benefit is that they are more efficient and optimize memory beacuse the values are produced dynamically one at a time on the fly and then discarded.

```
#Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')
```

```
#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')
```

```
#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')
```
